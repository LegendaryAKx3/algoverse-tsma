So if you have the choice, you should defect. But wait, the problem says \"based on your opponent\\'s previous decisions.\" But since it\\'s the first round, there are no previous decisions. So maybe the answer is to defect? Because in the first round, if you defect, you can get 5 points if they cooperate, which is better than cooperating and getting 3.

So if I defect, I get 5, which is better than 0. So the answer should be Defect. But wait, maybe there's a different angle. If I defect, I get 5, but if I cooperate, I get 0. But since the opponent is defecting, maybe they are trying to maximize their own points. So if I cooperate, I get 0, but if I defect, I get 5. So the optimal choice is to Defect. So the answer is [Defect].\n",
